<!-- Add buttons here -->

<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

In this notebook, we will visualize COVID-19 data from the first several weeks of the outbreak to see at what point this virus became a global pandemic.

<!-- Add a demo for your project -->

<!-- After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.

Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.

# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

- [Project Title](#project-title)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Installation](#installation)

# Installation

<!-- *You might have noticed the **Back to top** button(if not, please notice, it's right there!). This is a good idea because it makes your README **easy to navigate.*** 
 -->
 
On this Github repo, navigate to the appropriate python notebook (*.ipynb). Click the "Run in Colab" link on the top of the lab. That's it!
